# waldo-exif
Sample EXIF extraction and query tool

You will need VirtualBox and Vagrant installed on your machine.
Navigate to the `waldo-exif` directory, and run:

```
vagrant up
```

This should provision a new VM (Ubuntu 16.04) on [http://192.168.33.11]

You can edit your `/etc/hosts` file to give your VM a nice local name:

```
192.168.33.11    local.waldo-exif.com
```

If you do so, you can access [http://local.waldo-exif.com] instead.
